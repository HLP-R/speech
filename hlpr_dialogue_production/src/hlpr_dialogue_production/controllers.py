"""Defines functions to create behavior controllers for dialogue production.

This module contains functions that create controllers for each of the
behaviors that one might want to synchronize with robot speech.  Currently,
this includes looking at a point in space, executing a gesture with pre-
defined waypoints, and a test controller that just plays a beeping sound (and
can be used to check synchronization).
